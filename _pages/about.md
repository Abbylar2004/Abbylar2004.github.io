As a penultimate Actuarial Science student at Bayes Bayes School (formerly known as Cass), I have dived headfirst into the world of data-driven risk analysis and financial modelling. My coursework has been my launchpad, equipping me with the essential skills and insights into the dynamic world of finance.

Demystifying Financial Data
======
Using statistical software such as MS Excel and Minitab, I have gained a keen understanding of stock indices, making me adept at interpreting market trends and potential risks. In an investigation into the relationship between the historical prices of the indices S&P 500, BEL20, and Euro Stoxx 50, I analysed the confidence intervals for the population parameters (mean, variance, and proportion), the stochasticity of large changes in prices observed in each index and fitted normal distributions of each index. In addition to this, I recently completed a project of fitting a random walk model with normally distributed increments and that with discrete increments to the historical prices of DAX40 (formerly DAX30) and the Shanghai SE Composite.
