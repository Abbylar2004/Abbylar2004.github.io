As a penultimate Actuarial Science student at Bayes Bayes School (formerly known as Cass), I have dived headfirst into the world of data-driven risk analysis and financial modelling. My coursework has been my launchpad, equipping me with the essential skills and insights into the dynamic world of finance.

Demystifying Financial Data
======
Using statistical software such as MS Excel and Minitab, I have gained a keen understanding of stock indices, making me adept at interpreting market trends and potential risks. In an investigation into the relationship between the historical prices of the indices S&P 500, BEL20, and Euro Stoxx 50, I analysed the confidence intervals for the population parameters (mean, variance, and proportion), the stochasticity of large changes in prices observed in each index and fitted normal distributions of each index. In addition to this, I recently completed a project of fitting a random walk model with normally distributed increments and with discrete increments to the historical prices of DAX40 (formerly DAX30) and the Shanghai SE Composite. This project educated me on how to unravel the price patterns of stock indices and pinpoint the factors (local or global) driving their movements.

Modelling Financial Options
======
My exploration of call option payoffs, from European to American call options has enabled me to master simulating their behaviours, extracting valuable insights into potential risks and rewards associated with these instruments.

Risk Management in Action
======
Using R studios, I have analysed risk profiles of different insurance lines of business, understanding how each contributes to the overall risk landscape.
